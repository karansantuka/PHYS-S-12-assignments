### 2nd Class [7/27/2019]
<img src="classep.jpg" alt="classboard" style="height: 160px; max-width: 100%">
<br>Today we learnt some important stuff such as using a multimeter to find the voltage across different parts of a circuit, parts of an arduino and the ohm's law
<li>we found that the total voltage provided by the arduino is constant in a circuit</li>

<li> We also learnt about the parts of an arduino, which I found quite informative.</li><br>

<li> Ohms law states that </li> <br>
<H4> RESISTANCE = VOLTAGE/CURRENT </H4>
<br> Using this equation we can find one of the values using 2 of the given values. 
<br> We found how our program reacted to the voltage values of our cricuit on a scale of 1023 which is = 2^10 - 1 basically.

<br><i><H3> (I) Precautions </H3></i>
 

1. loose clothes and long hair must be tied
2. be aware of your surroundings and know your stuff!


We learnt the important and basic usage of sawing, drilling, cutting cardboards [I finally know how!! I think .. :) ] 
<li><i><H3> 1. Cutting Cardboard & Sawing pieces of wood, acrylic, metals</H3></i></li>

<br> We learnt measuring a carboard piece and cutting it to a size which would fit into the lazer cutter, about which we will learn in the following week. We learnt sawing pieces of wood, then we learnt that saws are of two types the "PUSH" saw which effectively cuts when the saw is pushed and the "PULL" saw which effectively cuts when the saw is pulled. When cutting metals the frequency of the sound allowed us to judge when our piece of metal is almost compeletely cut. It was something new for me & I believe learning this will help me somewhere later on.

<li><i> <H3> 2. Drilling holes of different sizes and then inserting thin rods in there firmly using super glue </H3></i></li>
<br>
This was one of the most important thing of our lab session. We used a "vernier calliper" tomeasure the diameter of our sawed piece of metal and then drilled a hole into a plate of that diameter. We then firly joined our piece of metal into our newly formed hole using a super glue, which acted really fast. Also learnt about the different types of glue like the wood glue which is used for joining two pieces of wood as the  name suggests. It was something I had never done before and look forward to its applications in my final project.

<li><i><H3> 3. Experiencing Augmented Reality 	to viusualize voltage drops along a circuit</H3></i></li>
<br>We were able to use a hololens to visualize voltage drops  of a circuit in Augmented Reality. This was quite cool, as I had never experienced anything of the sort before. Moreover we got to use it in its pilot stage, which was also quite amazing. After activiating the system suing gesture control, I was able to visualize the different voltage drops along different parts of the circuit.  <br>
