### My Idea

Through the skills I learn within this course I intend to build a compact miniature rover which can go through places hard for us to reach.
<li>It can help us in finding lost items quite easily (using a grip material)<li>
<i>it will be having sensors for it's smooth movement and information exchange between the rover and the user.<li>
It could also have infrared viewing technology which would be transferred live with the user<li></i>
