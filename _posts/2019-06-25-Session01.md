### 1st Class

In our First class we learned about the different tools available in the lab which would help us in creating our final project.
It was nice learning about our different classmates and their ideas about the course.

<B> 1st Lab Class

I learnt how to program the "Blink" on the arduino and also learnt soldering, an effective way to join two substances. I also learnt heat shrinking using the heat gun.
