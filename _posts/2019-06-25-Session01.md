### My Idea

Through the skills I learn within this course I intend to build a compact miniature rover which can go through places hard for us to reach.
It can help us in finding lost items quite easily
it will be having sensors for it's smooth movement and information exchange between the rover and the user.
It could also have infrared viewing technology which would be transferred live with the user
