### My Idea

Through the skills I learn within this course I intend to build a compact miniature rover which can go through places hard for us to reach.
<i><li>It can help us in finding lost items quite easily (using a grip material)
<li>it will be having sensors for it's smooth movement and information exchange between the rover and the user.
<li> It could also have infrared viewing technology which would be transferred live with the user	</i>
