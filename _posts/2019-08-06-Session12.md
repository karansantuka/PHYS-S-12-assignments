### My Idea for the Final Project [originally]

Through the skills I learn within this course I intend to build a compact miniature rover which can go through places hard for us to reach.
<li>It can help us in finding lost items quite easily (using a grip material)
<li>it will be having sensors for it's smooth movement and information exchange between the rover and the user.
<li> It could also have infrared viewing technology which would be transferred live with the user

### My Idea for the Final Project [Updated]

I'll be working on arduino operated motors in order to move a platform ... I envision this turning into a miniature electric skateboard ... I believe its uniqueness will lie in its compact and portable structure on which i hope to work on in future lab days! 
<br>
Using the laser cutter allowed me to envision this project more clearly. I still need to learn more about the working of arduinos and programming them. 
<br>
<li> I plan using a wii remote as a controller to this skateboard which could be connected via a bliuetooth connection
<li> I might have to use multiple arduinos linked together if I am not able to control the skateboard using one arduino
<li> As of now I need to learn more about servo motors
