### My Idea

<b>Through the skills I learn within this course I intend to build a compact miniature rover which can go through places hard for us to reach.
<li>It can help us in finding lost items quite easily (using a grip material)
<li>it will be having sensors for it's smooth movement and information exchange between the rover and the user.
<li> It could also have infrared viewing technology which would be transferred live with the user

<!-- You can include links and images in the following format: -->

[Link Description](url) and ![Alternative text](motor.jpg)


<!-- Or, you can also directly include HTML, for example to make a split image -->

<img src="board1.jpg" alt="Board Traces" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">
<img src="board2.jpg" alt="Board Interior" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">


<!-- You can also use HTML tags to include a video -->
<video width="955" height="541" controls>
	<source src="demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<!-- Or to add a download link to any (reasonably small) file in your permalink directory -->
