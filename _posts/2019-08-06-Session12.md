### My Idea for the Final Project [originally]

<b>Through the skills I learn within this course I intend to build a compact miniature rover which can go through places hard for us to reach.
<li>It can help us in finding lost items quite easily (using a grip material)
<li>it will be having sensors for it's smooth movement and information exchange between the rover and the user.
<li> It could also have infrared viewing technology which would be transferred live with the user


updated .... 

I'll be working on arduino operated motorsin order to move a platform ... I envision this turning into a miniature electric skateboard ... I believe its uniqueness will lie in its compact and portable structure on which i hope to work on in future lab days!
