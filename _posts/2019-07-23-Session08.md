<h2>CNC milling and Moulds (Using Composites)</h2> 


<h3> We learn another subtractive method - CNC machine. Me and my partner, Fadi decided to mould a design of the world map! This required some precision for which we had to use 1/4inch screw in the cnc machine.
<br>
The CNC machine
<br>
Computer Numerical Control is the automated control of machining tools (drills, boring tools, lathes) and 3D printers by means of a computer. A CNC machine processes a piece of material (metal, plastic, wood, ceramic, or composite) to meet specifications by following a coded programmed instruction and without a manual operator.

We've already talked about some kinds of CNC machines. Today we'll focus on CNC Milling.

The CNC machine was incredibly fast when comparing to the use of 3D printers! Though the lab had a fairly smaller machine, the applications of the CNC machine on a large scale must be really helpful , like in the airplane industry and in building properties!
This is another piece of tech which I never myself used or saw before.

As our model required some precise cutting, we tried to use the cnc machine to cut 90* , so that it would have less area to cover and show more precision
<br>

<br>
Then we had to make the mold, for which we decided to use burlap. Burlap is s=a stronger material than canvas! Here is the coating process!

Above is a small depiction of h0w the process is supposed to work! Once we had placed the burlaps on top, after laser cutting them out!

<br>
Then it was time to place the bleeder layer and covering it with the breather layer (it had holes on it using the wierd like tool) 
<br>

</video>
<br>
Then it was time to place our finished piece into a vaccum bag, the vaccumming process pushed the epoxy+fiber(burlap in our case) to the foam cut out!
It was really cool to watch it shrink!
<br>
Now we let the piece stay overnight and wait to see what comes out! Fingers crossed ^^
