### CNC milling and Moulds (Using Composites)
<h6>We learn another subtractive method - CNC machine. Me and my partner, Fadi decided to mould a design of the world map! This required some precision for which we had to use 1/4inch screw in the cnc machine.

The CNC machine

Computer Numerical Control is the automated control of machining tools (drills, boring tools, lathes) and 3D printers by means of a computer. A CNC machine processes a piece of material (metal, plastic, wood, ceramic, or composite) to meet specifications by following a coded programmed instruction and without a manual operator.

We've already talked about some kinds of CNC machines. Today we'll focus on CNC Milling.

The CNC machine was incredibly fast when comparing to the use of 3D printers! Though the lab had a fairly smaller machine, the applications of the CNC machine on a large scale must be really helpful , like in the airplane industry and in building properties!
This is another piece of tech which I never myself used or saw before. As every class
