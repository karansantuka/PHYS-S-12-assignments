<h1>Final project</h1>



Having decided upon making a robot that can solve a maze, I decided to use ultrasonic sensors.
<br>
An Ultrasonic sensor is a device that can measure the distance to an object by using sound waves. It measures distance by sending out a sound wave at a specific frequency and listening for that sound wave to bounce back. By recording the elapsed time between the sound wave being generated and the sound wave bouncing back.This seems similar to the working of Sonar and Radar.

I had a laser cut acrylic sheet to hold the brain! Below is the layout: 
<img src="layout.jpg" alt="Board Traces" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">
