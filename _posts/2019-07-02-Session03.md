### 3rd class [7/2/2019] 

We started by learning some mechancial theory - about screws, the different types and their types and notation<br>

<br>
We then moved on to learning some of the key aspects of this course i.e. Laser Cutting using Fusion 360 and Vinyl Cutting

<h2>Using Fusion 360</h2>
<br>
I learnt something completely new and helpful in this session, using a CAD program to build almost any design.

1. Creating a sketch
2. saving the sketch as a DxF file in order to make it compatible with laser cutter


Fusion 360 enabled me in making structures and designs that will be very useful in any field of study/research

<br>
As a first attempt at creating something useful, i decided to build a phone holder

It didnt come out so well at first due to my errors in measurement. But after understanding important things like kerf and fillets, I was able to improvise my model. It is still not perfect and there is much room for improvisation.
<br>
It was amazing to view the capabilities of the laser cutter, it allowed to break many bounds. It is indeed an amazing piece of technology.
