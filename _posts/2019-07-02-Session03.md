### 3rd class [7/2/2019] 

We started by learning some mechancial theory - about screws, the different types and their uses and notation<br>

<br>
We then moved on to learning some of the key aspects of this course i.e. Laser Cutting using Fusion 360 and Vinyl Cutting
<br>

<br>
Also got to view an amazing model that had been laser printed <br>

<h3>Using Fusion 360 to Laser Print</h3>
<br>
I learnt something completely new and helpful in this session, using a CAD program to build almost any design.

1. Creating a sketch
2. saving the sketch as a DxF file in order to make it compatible with laser cutter

<br>
Fusion 360 enabled me in making structures and designs that will be very useful in any field of study/research
<br>

<br>
As a first attempt at creating something useful, i decided to build a phone holder 
<br>

<img src="o2.jpg" alt="model2" style="height: 160px; max-width: 100%">

It didnt come out so well at first due to my errors in measurement. But after understanding important things like kerf and fillets, I was able to improvise my model. It is still not perfect and there is much room for improvisation.
<br>
It was amazing to view the capabilities of the laser cutter, it allowed to break many bounds. It is indeed an amazing piece of technology.

I believe that the laser cutter will be quite helpful for my final project which is to build a miniatrue electric skateboard.

<h3>Vinyl Cutter</h3>

After Learning how to operate the laser cutter, we learnt how to operate another powerful piece of tech - The Vinyl Cutter
<br>
We were allowed to use the vinyl cutter and I was able to print out a little japanese design. It was quite hard to carefully scrap out the small details of the japanase letters :)

<br>
The Vinyl Cutter has capabalities that need not be overlooked (which i feel i did after using the laser cutter ^^ )

<h3>Summary</h3><br>
Leanring about screws, Learning to use Fusion 360, and learnig about the laser cutter and vinyl cutter. I see these sessions as a great introduction to important tech, as they help open many doors of innovation. I am very excited for the future classes.

What I have learned so far:

1. Basics of arduino and simple electronics
2. Soldering
3. Heat shrinking
4. Sawing, cutting, Drilling
5. Using Fusion 360 & Laser Cutting
6. Using the Vinyl Cutter
7. Some knowledge of voltages & resistance
8. measuring

and more to come...
