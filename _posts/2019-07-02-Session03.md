### 3rd class [7/2/2019] 

We started by learning some mechancial theory - about screws, the different types and their types and notation<br>

<br>
We then moved on to learning some of the key aspects of this course i.e. Laser Cutting using Fusion 360 and Vinyl Cutting
<br>

<br>
Also got to view an amazing model that had been laser printed <br>

<h3>Using Fusion 360 to Laser Print</h3>
<br>
I learnt something completely new and helpful in this session, using a CAD program to build almost any design.

1. Creating a sketch
2. saving the sketch as a DxF file in order to make it compatible with laser cutter


Fusion 360 enabled me in making structures and designs that will be very useful in any field of study/research
<br>

<br>
As a first attempt at creating something useful, i decided to build a phone holder

<img src="o2.jpg" alt="model2" style="height: 160px; max-width: 100%">

It didnt come out so well at first due to my errors in measurement. But after understanding important things like kerf and fillets, I was able to improvise my model. It is still not perfect and there is much room for improvisation.
<br>
It was amazing to view the capabilities of the laser cutter, it allowed to break many bounds. It is indeed an amazing piece of technology.

<h3>Vinyl Cutter</h3>

After Learning how to operate the laser cutter, we learnt how to operate another powerful piece of tech - The Vinyl Cutter
<br>
We were allowed to use the vinyl cutter and I was able to print out a little japanese design.

<br>
The Vinyl Cutter has capabalities that need not be overlooked (which i feel i did after using the laser cutter ^^ )
