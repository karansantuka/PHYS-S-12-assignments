### Output Devices

I used a sonar sensor to detect the proximity of a nearby object! I had to display this using the LCD. Apparently the LCD didnt work out, but I was able to get an accurate output on the serial monitor!
<br>
Theory:
<br>
Here , we are going to calculate the distance of the sensor and any object in front of it. 

At t1 we send the trigger signal , and at t2 we get the echo.

so dt = t2-t1

And as dt is the time for the sound taken to reach to the object and return back;

The exact time taken by the sound to reach the object is : dt/2

Now , Normal speed of sound is: 340.29 m / s 

And converting it to Centimeters per Micro Seconds gives : 0.034049 CM / microseconds

The actual distance traveled by the sound or the distance between the sensor and the object is:

(dt/2) * 0.034049

Which is the exact formula used in the software.

<h3> My challenges in this project! </h3>

1. Soldering
<br> i was terrible at soldering and almost completely shorted my arduino! But then with the help of Andrei, I was able to immprove my soldering abilities!
After using the solder braid and to suck away all the extra solder, luckily I found that the Arduino Micro I was suing had not yet fried up!
2. Using the Sonar appropriately
<br>
It was important to learen about the PulseIn function. Which gave the time and the multiplying that by the speed of sound gave me the distance from the object!

<br>

My final idea is to integrate these components onto my project so as to add the feature of collision protection! I could control the motor with relative to the distance from any nearby object!

<br>
The codes are as below:

The above is with LCD but the below is the code in which I use the serial plotter!

Professor Rob had helped me a lot in figuring out the issues with the setup I had and evetually even help me come with the working design! We went overtime for the same! Really appreciate his help in the same
