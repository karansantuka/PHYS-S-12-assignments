### 4th Class 

This was more of a theoretical class where we studied more about the arduino. The pins on it - The pins on the Arduino can be configured as either inputs or outputs. We learnt the very important concept of PWN - Pulse width Modulation 
It is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between full on (5 Volts) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width. If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and 5v controlling the brightness of the LED.

We then took a headstart into some arduino programming. I was able to observe the similiarities b/w the arduino program and coding languages such as c++ & python
<br>
We then were assigned to make a quick prototype of our final projects. This was quite challenging. But as a result of this challenge I was able to learn about motor drivers, DC motors and Servo Motors.
<br>
Having done some ressearch and some important help from Nathan, I was able to create a working circuit
<br>
I had to make some edits to a preset code on Arduino IDE in order to set the speeds of the motors and controls and delays

Then I implanted this circuit into some laser cut cardboard. I tried to have the carboards to be as sturdy as possible. But due to the shortage of time I was able to come with only a small structure

I dont think I was succesful in this challenge, but I'm glad that I could  learn some new things over short span of time.
I'm looking forward to future challenges where  I will learn many more new things
