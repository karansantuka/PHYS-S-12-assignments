### INPUT DEVICEZ

In this class' lecture we learnt about the very fundamental components of any working electronic system , which are sensors.
<br>
There are different types of sensors:
<br>
1. Light
2. Sound
3. Temperature
4. Fluids
5. Electricity & Magnetism
6. Motion
7. Proximity/Distance
<br>
Though for my Final projects I intend to work with Proximity sensors to avoid clashes. For which Nathan suggested the use of Ultrasonic sensors which weren't  available in the lab at the time! 
<br>
i took the time to learn  about Temperature sensors! I found the idewa of a a sensor working with the help of Temperature sensitivity to be really cool!

I designed my circuit as above to allow the Thermistor to detect any change in temperature and report it on the serial monitor!
It worked out perfectly!
<br>
I had to apply the Steinhart-Hart equation into the program:
<br>
The Steinhart–Hart equation is a model of the resistance of a semiconductor at different temperatures. The equation is

<br>
The program worked properly after a few corrections in my resistance measurement! I did forget how to use the multimeter :P ... It worked out well towards the end after all the debugging!

I spent the remaining of my time in designing parts for my final project! Updates regarding which can always be found in the final project page :D
<br>
As usual there was a lot of new things for me to learn from Proffesor Rob as well as my classmates! I hope to apply what I learnt on to my final project model!
