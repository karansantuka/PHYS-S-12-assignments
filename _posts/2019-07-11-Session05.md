### 5th Class

 ARDUINO WORKSHOP

<br>
This class was a workshop to explain the very basics of Arduino Programming. We started off by learning about the sample Button example.
I was able to properly understand the concept of arduino programming with numerous code examples that were explained.
<br>
<b>THE BUTTON</b>

<br>
Then I tried to create a code to accelerate a motor with indication using the following code;

</video>
<br>
<b>THE CODE I USED:</b> 
<br>
<img src="b.png" alt="modelview" style="height: 490px; max-width: 167%">
<br>
One of the key things that I learnt was debugging: The Serial command and the usage of the Multimeter came of utmost importance to me here when I tried to work on my assignment!
<br>
<b>FUSION 360 </b>
<br>
We also had an assignment to build a 3D model on Fusion 360. I came across a snap fit case on youtube which was really well explained.
I then worked on Fusion 360 to create a similiar snap fit case.

<br>
I learnt about using the shell. The User Defined Paramters played a major role here! The made the process so much more efficient		
I can't wait to 3D Print this out!
