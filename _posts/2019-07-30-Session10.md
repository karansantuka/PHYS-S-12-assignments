<h1> Molding and Casting </h1>


<h3> We actually started off with a workshop on wearbale elctronics sewing! How different fabrics with different properties are integrated with textiles. The workshop focused on some actuators from the wyss institute.

For our assignment we wither had to sew or cast a mold! Having used a sewing machine before I thought that I'd be more interested in doing something new in molding/casting. So i decided to cast a model of a Knight from the chess board! I luckily found a file available for download!<br>

The Process was quite interesting.  After mixing the oosoo and silicon in equal proportion just enough so that their colors would be indistinguishable! And also that there should be no air bubbles.
The next part was slowly pouring the solution onto our model until it was completely submerged! The model had to be stuck with clay onto another cup so that it would stay put when it is submerged!

In my case I will have to wait for mold overnight to rest and get ready for removal! 

This was something I had never done before and was quite cool to learn  that such things are possible
