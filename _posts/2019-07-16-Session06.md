### 3D PRINTING

We were introduced with 3D 	printing in this class. It was amazing to see the different designs built using the types of printers available in the lab. 
Having seen some tutorials I decided to try to make a snap fit case.
After a couple of hours of figuring the different components of Fusion360, I was able to come with a model.
<br>

It consisted of 2 parts, the top cover and the case itself!

<img src="afu1.png" alt="modelview" style="height: 490px; max-width: 167%">
<br>
The goal was to have the top cover snap into the case by just pushing it on its top. So the clutches had to be perfect in dimensions.

<br>
As u can see in this section analysis.
<br>
I think most of Fusion 360 that i learnt was because of this assignment - Shell, Chamfer, Making use of user defined parameters.

<br>

Then it was time to 3D print the design. On my first attempt the print broke off midway. This was because of incforrect orientation. I should have layed the model flat for printing, which I did on my 2nd attempt. It came out5 perfectly.

<br>
The lab has different 3D printers - Prusas, Sindohs, and the ultimaker.
<br>
After having used the Prusa I tried to use the Sindoh, which unlike the Prusa needed the 3DWOX software. The Prusa managed with the Ultimaker Cura software.

This had been a really interesting lab session and I am looking forward to its applications on my Final Project!
