 I am a senior at my high school in Kuwait, in the Middle East. I serve in the deputy student council there. For my hobbies, I enjoy playing basketball & Chess and participating in MUNs. I think I have very little experience(little coding of Python and C++) of what I will learn in this course. Therefore I'm really looking forward to learning from this course, and taking back something new this summer.  <p>
